###Let's break down the code step by step:

### Leds_and_Button_Func()
This function is named Leds_and_Button_Func and does not take any arguments. It's a void function, indicating that it doesn't return any values.

static int State_Red = 0, State_Green = 0, State_Yellow = 0, State_Blue = 0;: Four integer variables (State_Red, State_Green, State_Yellow, and State_Blue) are declared and initialized to 0. These variables are used to keep track of the states (on or off) of the corresponding LEDs.

The code then enters a conditional structure where it checks the status of four buttons (Button_1, Button_2, Button_3, and Button_4) using the Button_X_Read() functions (where X represents the button number). Here's what happens for each button:

if (Button_1_Read() == 1): If Button 1 is pressed (its status is 1), it toggles the state of the red LED by performing a bitwise NOT operation (~) on State_Red. If State_Red is 0, it becomes 1, and vice versa. The state change is then written to the red LED using Led_Red_Write(State_Red).

Similar actions are performed for Button 2, Button 3, and Button 4, toggling the states of the green, yellow, and blue LEDs, respectively.

After processing the button states and updating the LED states, the code introduces a delay of 180 milliseconds using CyDelay(180). This delay ensures that the button states are not processed too quickly and provides a debounce effect to prevent multiple rapid button presses from being counted as multiple toggles.

### Summary
In summary, this code creates a function that monitors four buttons and toggles the states of corresponding LEDs when the buttons are pressed. It uses static variables to maintain the LED states, and a delay is added to control the update rate. This code is typical in embedded systems where hardware components are controlled by user input, such as button presses.
