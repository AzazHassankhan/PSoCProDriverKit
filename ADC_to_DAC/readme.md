# 🎛️ ADC to DAC Interface in PSoC 🎚️

This repository showcases an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) interface designed using the Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC) architecture by Cypress Semiconductor. The project focuses on converting analog signals to digital, processing them, and reconverting them back to analog for various applications.

### 🔍 Key Features:

**PSoC-Based Design:** Utilizes the flexible and configurable PSoC platform for ADC and DAC interfacing.
**ADC Sampling:** Demonstrates ADC functionality to sample analog signals accurately.
**Signal Processing:** Incorporates signal processing techniques or algorithms to manipulate sampled data.
**DAC Reconstruction:** Reconstructs processed digital signals back into the analog domain using the DAC.
**Code Examples:** Provides comprehensive code snippets and examples for ADC and DAC configurations.
### 🚀 Usage:

Clone the repository to your local environment.  
Open the project in Cypress' PSoC Creator IDE.  
Explore the different modules and configurations for ADC and DAC.  
Customize the code for your specific analog signal processing requirements.   
Simulate and test the ADC to DAC interface.
