# Pulse Width Modulation ⚙️

⚡️ PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is a technique used in electronics and embedded systems to control the average power delivered to a load by rapidly switching it on and off. This is achieved by varying the width of the "on" pulse while keeping the frequency constant. PWM is a crucial tool in controlling the speed of motors, brightness of LEDs, and other applications where precise control of power is needed.

In this repository it is used to controls a dynamic LED fading, creating captivating lighting effects.

📜 Code Explanation: 📜

🌈 The PWM_Led_Fader_Func function gradually fades LEDs in and out to create a colorful and dynamic lighting effect.

🚀 The PWM_Start_Func function initializes and starts the PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) modules for controlling the LED intensity.

🌟 The main function enables global interrupts, starts the PWM modules, and continuously runs the LED fading function to create a captivating LED light show.
