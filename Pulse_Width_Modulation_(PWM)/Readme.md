# Pulse Width Modulation ⚙️

This GitHub repository hosts a dazzling PWM LED Fader application. Using the power of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), this code creates a mesmerizing light show that smoothly fades LEDs in and out.


### 📜 Code Explanation: 📜

🌈 The PWM_Led_Fader_Func function gradually fades LEDs in and out to create a colorful and dynamic lighting effect.

🚀 The PWM_Start_Func function initializes and starts the PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) modules for controlling the LED intensity.

🌟 The main function enables global interrupts, starts the PWM modules, and continuously runs the LED fading function to create a captivating LED light show.

### 🌟 Key Features 🌟

✨ **PWM Magic:** The code demonstrates the art of PWM, allowing for the graceful fading of LEDs.  
🌈 **Multicolored Brilliance:** Three different PWM channels control the brightness of LEDs, creating a colorful display.  
🕰️ **Precise Timing:** The code includes precise timing with the CyDelay function to ensure smooth transitions.  

### 📈 Usage 📈

📥 Clone or download the repository.  
🚀 Load the code onto your microcontroller or development board.  
💡 Watch as the LEDs dance with enchanting fades!  

### Want to dive deeper into PWM?
⚡️ PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is a technique used in electronics and embedded systems to control the average power delivered to a load by rapidly switching it on and off. This is achieved by varying the width of the "on" pulse while keeping the frequency constant. PWM is a crucial tool in controlling the speed of motors, brightness of LEDs, and other applications where precise control of power is needed.
