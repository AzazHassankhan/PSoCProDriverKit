# UART Communication 📡

Welcome to the "Simple UART Communication" repository! This code showcases basic UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication using an embedded system, and it's as simple as sending and receiving messages. Let's dive into the code step by step: ⚙️

### 📜 Code Overview:

💌 **Uart_String_Func():** This function is responsible for transmitting a simple message. It sends "Starting" followed by a carriage return ("\r") through the UART. This is your project's kick-off message! 🚀

🔢 **Uart_Int_Func():** In this function, we're converting an integer (in this case, 1) to a string using the sprintf function. The resulting string is then sent via UART. Imagine sending numeric data from your device! 

📊 **Uart_get_Func():**
The function is used to receive a character via UART, and the received character is stored in the **receive** variable.
The code then checks the value of the receive variable:
If it's equal to '1', the code turns on the red LED (Red_Led_Write(1)).
If it's equal to '2', the code turns off the red LED (Red_Led_Write(0)).

📡 **UART Communication:** UART is the go-to communication method for many embedded systems. It enables your device to talk with other devices or even your computer. 🌐

🚀 **Why UART?:** UART is widely used in the world of embedded systems for its simplicity and versatility. It's perfect for transmitting data, debugging, and more.

🔌 **hterm:** "hterm" is a vital component of this code, enhancing the user experience by facilitating communication over UART. It acts as the bridge connecting your device to a terminal or host system, allowing for seamless data exchange. 🌟
