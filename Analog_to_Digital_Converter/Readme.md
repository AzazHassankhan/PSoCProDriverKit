# Analog to Digital Converter

🚀 **Project Overview** 🚀

This repository hosts code that plays a pivotal role in our software projects. It serves as a foundational component for various applications. The code in this repository uses a joystick to dynamically adjust the brightness of an LED Using ADC and PWM.

**!** Uart is also used to see the ADC Convertion...

📤 **Function: UART_func** 📤

The `UART_func` function sends integer values over UART communication. It seamlessly converts the given integer into a string representation and sends it via UART. This function includes a carriage return ("\r") for accurate transmission completion.

🔌 **Function: Component_Starter_Func** 🔌

The `Component_Starter_Func` function provides a one-stop solution for initializing and starting crucial components in our system. It ensures that UART communication, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), and the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) are properly initialized and ready for operation.

📊 **Function: ADC_Func** 📊

The `ADC_Func` function is designed to read analog values from an ADC channel. It manages the ADC conversion process, waits for the conversion to finish, and returns the resulting analog value as an integer.
