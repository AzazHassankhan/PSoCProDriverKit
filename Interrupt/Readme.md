# Interrupt Service Routines 🔄

🌐📊  This code in the repository leverages PSoC technology to create a system that reacts to button presses.

🔴 Two interrupt service routines (ISRs) - "Button1" and "Button2" - control the red and green LEDs. When a button press is detected, these ISRs toggle the state of the respective LED, resulting in a blinking effect. 🚦💡

🔄🌐 The main function starts by enabling global interrupts and then calls "Interrupt_Start_Func," which initializes the ISRs to respond to button presses.

🎉✨ The outcome is a simple yet foundational demonstration of how embedded systems can respond to external events, and it opens the door to countless possibilities in the realm of IoT and hardware control. Explore, learn, and create with this repository! 🚀🔧
